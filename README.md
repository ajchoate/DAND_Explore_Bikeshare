# Explore Bikeshare Project
## Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree

#### Alyssa Choate

To complete this project exploring Bikeshare data from New York City, Washington DC, and Chicago, I referenced practice problems 1, 2, and 3 in the Explore US Bikeshare Data lesson within the Data Analysis Nanodegree program, as well as the Iterators and Generators quiz in Lesson 4 - Functions, and the Handling Errors section of Lesson 5 - Scripting.

Outside of the Nanodegree curriculum, I also referred to the [pandas 0.23.0 API Reference documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html) for help with 'datetimelike' properties (such as Series.dt.hour), DataFrame attributes and indexing information (for properties like DataFrame.ndim and DataFrame.iloc).
